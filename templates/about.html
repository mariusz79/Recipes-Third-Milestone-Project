        <p class="flow-text about-terms-text"> The Industrial Revolution brought mass-production, mass-marketing and
            standardization of food. Factories processed,
            preserved, canned, and packaged a wide variety of foods, and processed cereals quickly became a defining
            feature of the
            American breakfast. In the 1920s, freezing methods, cafeterias and fast food restaurants emerged.</p>

            Most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well
            as herbs and
            spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast
            used in baking
            are kinds of fungi. Cooks also use water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use wine or spirits.</p>
        <p class="flow-text about-terms-text">
            Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins, carbohydrates and
            fats. They also
            contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

            Carbohydrates include the common sugar, sucrose (table sugar), a disaccharide, and such simple sugars as
            glucose (made
            by enzymatic splitting of sucrose) and fructose (from fruit), and starches from sources such as cereal
            flour, rice,
            arrowroot and potato.</p>
        <p class="flow-text about-terms-text">
            The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex. Long-chain sugars such as starch tend to break down
            into simpler
            sugars when cooked, while simple sugars can form syrups. If sugars are heated so that all water of
            crystallisation is
            driven off, then caramelization starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation
            of carbon,
            and other breakdown products producing caramel. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the
            Maillard
            reaction, a basic flavor-enhancing technique.</p>
